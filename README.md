# 67 Minutes to NumPy

## Overview
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a powerful, proven library for data processing and linear algebra for Python. NumPy has been one of the driving factors of Python's use and adoption in scientific computing communities. It's fast, powerful, and direct. You want linear algebra? Use NumPy! Need an n-dimensional tensor for a neural network? Use NumPy! Want to process numerical data more directly using vectorized operations instead of loops and conditionals? Use NumPy!

Using this video and notebook introduction will help you get started with numpy extremely rapidly.
